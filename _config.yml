    title: Platform Features
    description: >
      Our platform allows for streamlined on-boarding, only
      requiring our customers to install a version control system provider
      integration to get started. Once integrated, our customers have immediate
      access to on-demand security engineering resources across all of our
      service offerings, and are able to configure how they are used by their
      organization.

    - title: Continuous Code Review
      features:
        - name: Native version control provider integration
          description: >
            Native integration allows for faster time-to-review, and simple
            onboarding of services. All feedback within our platform can be
            forwarded to the version control provider, such as GitHub issues,
            discussions, and pull requests.

          description:
            Our customers define scope for each review, ensuring appropriate
            staffing every time. Donâ€™t want to manually approve scope every
            time? Create pre-configured scopes for common requests.

        - name: Patching and remediation
          description: >
            Our engineers work directly with our customer's engineering teams to
            patch and remediate identified vulnerabilities. Paired with our code
            review offerings, this helps to prevent vulnerability regressions.
          icon: code
        - name: Detection engineering
          description: >
            After remediation is complete, our engineers help to engineer
            signatures to detect the exploitation of the vulnerability in the
            past, present, and future.
